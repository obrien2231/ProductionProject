# ProductionProject
This is a semester long project for the fall of 2020, and it is a production line tracker. I am working independently on this project throughout the course of this semester. 
The project began in August 2020, when I was pretty inexperienced with databases and object oriented programming. As my skill grows the project will be enhanced through
multiple sprints.
